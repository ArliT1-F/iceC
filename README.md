## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Bot Commands Not Working
- Ensure you're using `commands.Bot()` (already fixed in code)
- Check that the bot has proper permissions in your server
- Verify the command prefix is correct (`!` by default)

### Music Not Playing
- Ensure you have a Lavalink server running and accessible
- Check that the bot has permission to join voice channels
- Verify the node connection in `node_connect()`

### Trading Features Not Working
- Ensure Binance API keys are correctly set in `.env`
- Check that API keys have necessary permissions (read-only recommended)
- Verify `FAV_LIST.json` exists and has correct structure

### Permission Errors
- Ensure the bot has necessary roles/permissions:
  - Send Messages
  - Connect to Voice Channels
  - Speak in Voice Channels
  - Manage Roles (for moderation commands)
