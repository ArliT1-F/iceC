The to do list for iceC bot.

1. figure out how .env's work and use it to hide the bot token --- Solved (i am very stupid. 2024 me)
2. implement cogs for ease of use
3. make ffmpeg music commands ---obsolete (due to youtube_dl having huge problems atm. on hiatus until it gets fixed.)
4. maybe a small and simple game, or something fun like: the bot reads the chat and saves the most used lines from the users and appends them in a list. 
   this is so whenever you tag the bot or say its name, it will pick lines from the list and send  one of them in the chat randomly. --- On Hold
