# iceC Bot - TO-DO List & Ideas

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Environment Variables (.env)
- ✅ **SOLVED** - Bot now properly uses `.env` file to hide sensitive tokens and API keys
- ✅ All configuration moved to environment variables for security
- ✅ Added `.env` template in README.md

## 🚧 In Progress / Planned

### 2. Implement Cogs for Code Organization
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Reason:** Codebase is getting large (750+ lines in single file). Cogs will make it more maintainable.

**Suggested Cog Structure:**
```
cogs/
├── music.py        # All music commands (play, pause, queue, etc.)
├── trading.py      # Binance trading features (add_fav, favs, fubln)
├── moderation.py   # Moderation commands (kick, ban, mute, etc.)
└── utility.py      # Utility commands (ping, info, etc.)
```

**Benefits:**
- Better code organization
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Can reload cogs without restarting entire bot
- Team collaboration friendly

## 💡 Ideas & Feature Requests

### 3. FFmpeg Music Commands
**Status:** Obsolete / Canceled  
**Reason:** YouTube-DL had major issues. Bot now uses Wavelink which is more stable and feature-rich.  
**Current Solution:** ✅ Using Wavelink for music playback (better alternative)

---

### 4. Chat Learning & Response Bot (Fun Game Feature)
**Status:** On Hold  
**Priority:** Low-Medium  
**Idea:** Bot reads chat messages and saves frequently used phrases/lines from users. When bot is tagged or someone says its name, it randomly responds with one of the saved phrases.

**Implementation Suggestions:**
- Store phrases in JSON file (e.g., `chat_phrases.json`)
- Track message frequency (maybe top 10-20 most used phrases)
- Filter out commands and common Discord messages
- Add cooldown to prevent spam (maybe 1 response per 5 minutes)
- Allow admins to clear/reset phrases
- Optional: Add sentiment or context filtering

**Commands to Add:**
- `!learn` - Manually add a phrase (admin only?)
- `!phrases` - Show saved phrases
- `!forget` - Clear saved phrases (admin only)
- `!toggle-learn` - Enable/disable learning (admin only)

**Technical Notes:**
- Use message content intent (already enabled)
- Store phrases per server (guild-specific)
- Consider rate limiting to avoid learning spam
- Maybe add minimum phrase length (3+ words?)

## 📋 Additional Suggestions

### 5. Error Handling Improvements
**Status:** ✅ Mostly Done  
**Notes:** Added better error handling and logging. Could add more specific error messages for users.

### 6. Documentation
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Notes:** README.md has been updated with comprehensive documentation.

### 7. Testing
**Priority:** Medium  
**Idea:** Add unit tests for core functionality (queue management, command parsing, etc.)

### 8. Configuration File
**Priority:** Low  
**Idea:** Create a `config.py` or `config.json` for customizable settings (command prefix, default volume, etc.)

### 9. Database Integration
**Priority:** Low  
**Idea:** Replace JSON files with a proper database (SQLite for small scale, PostgreSQL for larger deployments)
- User preferences (favorite volume, etc.)
- Chat learning phrases
- Server-specific settings
- Playlist storage

### 10. Music Features Enhancement
**Priority:** Medium  
**Ideas:**
- Playlist saving/loading (user-specific)
- Search history
- Song recommendations based on queue
- Lyrics integration (partially commented out in code)

### 11. Trading Features Enhancement
**Priority:** Low  
**Ideas:**
- Price alerts (notify when crypto hits certain price)
- Portfolio tracking
- Trading statistics
- Multiple exchange support

### 12. Command Aliases Enhancement
**Priority:** Low  
**Idea:** Allow server admins to customize command aliases per server
