The to do list for iceC bot.

1. figure out how .env's work and use it to hide the bot token-----Solved
2. implement cogs for ease of use
3. make ffmpeg music commands 
4. maybe a small and simple game, or something fun like: the bot reads the chat and saves the most used lines from the users and appends them in a list. 
   this is so whenever you tag the bot or say its name, it will pick lines from the list and send  one of them in the chat randomly.
